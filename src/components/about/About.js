                I'm 20 years old. IÂ´ve been coding since June of 2020. I learned
                as much as I could since then.

                Everything happened really fast, the thought came into my mind
                and I knew I had to. So I started learning programming.

              <Paragraph>
                I fell in love immediately with what I'm doing. I'm always up to
                learn new things and technologies.
